# Leet-Code

Welcome to my LeetCode Progress Tracker repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my progress as I tackle the challenging coding problems on LeetCode. As I journey through different algorithmic and data structure problems, I'll be sharing my solutions, notes, and insights right here.

Key Features:
📂 Folders for Each Problem: I've organized the repository with folders named after each problem's title or number. Inside each folder, you'll find my solution code, explanations, and any relevant notes I've taken.

📝 Code and Explanations: Each solution is accompanied by a clear and well-commented code snippet. I've also added explanations to help myself (and others) understand the thought process behind the solution.

🔍 Searchable: Looking for a specific problem? The repository is designed to make searching for problems quick and easy. Just browse the folders or use GitHub's search feature.

📅 Progress Updates: I'll be using the commit history and branch management to document my journey. You can track my progress by looking at the commit history, and see how I've improved over time.

🤝 Community Interaction: If you stumble upon this repository and find my solutions helpful, feel free to leave comments or suggestions. Learning is a collaborative effort, and I'm open to discussions and improvements.

I'm excited to share my LeetCode journey with the world through this repository. It's not just about solving problems, but also about learning, growing, and becoming a better coder. Let's tackle those algorithms together! 💪

Happy coding! 🎉
